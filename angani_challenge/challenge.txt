KITAKALE KINGDOM BREAK IN:
{
	Bob and his army are planning to attack the greak Kitakale kingdom. King Mamba learns of this conspiracy
	and plans to lock the only door through which Bob's army can enter his Kingdom. But to lock the door
	King Mamba needs a key that is a palindrome of a certain anagram string. He has a bag which holds all
	the keys to the Kingdom's doors composed of lowercase English letters.


	A string 'aaabbbb' would open the door since an anagram of the string would be 'bbaaabb' which is a palindrome. Another anagram of the same string('aaabbbb') would be 'abbabba' which would open the door as well. The string 'aaabbbb' is a valid key and is considered only once even though it has more than one palindrome. 

	The file 'key_bag.txt' contains over 2000 keys to the Kingdom. Find the number of valid keys that would open the main door and the probability that King Mamba will pick a valid key in the first instance. Give your answer in the form (K, P), where 'K' is the number of valid keys for the main door and 'P' is the probability that King Mamba will pick a valid key for the main door.
