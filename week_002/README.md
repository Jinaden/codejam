{challenge approach}
=======================
Challenge A(Permuted multiples)

{

	Create a function(number1, number2) that checks if a number1 is a permutation of number2
	
	If we sort both numbers i.e number 1 and number2, then they should be equal if and only iff 
	they are permutations of one another

	e.g 6592 when sorted is 2569 and 5926 when sorted is 2569 which makes the numbers equal

	Loop thru a series of numbers say 1 to n as u check that 2n, 3n, 4n, 5n and 6n are equal to n
	using the sorting explained above

	Return n that satisfies the conditions
