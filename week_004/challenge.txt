CHALLENGE A
	An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:
	0.123456789101112131415161718192021…
	It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.
	If dn represents the nth digit of the fractional part,  and F(dn)  to be the nth factorial number, find the value of the following expression
	F(d1 ) × F( d10 ) × F( d100) × F( d1000) × F( d10000) × F( d100000) × F( d1000000)


CHALLENGE B
	The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.
	Find the product of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.
	NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.


CHALLENGE C
	We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime.
	Find the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists. What is the product of the digits of this pandigital prime?
